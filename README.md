# hi

i'm atlas !

not good with bios so [peep my messy strawpage](https://soggysweetroll.straw.page) for more info abt me & stuff i like

i often hang out in the comics area above spawn (18+). if i dont respond im probably offtab. but im also shy and talking to people makes me nervous as hell so there's also a chance im just sweating my arse off trying to figure out how to respond. since im also a 'multifandom' fella, i occasionally hang out as non-comic related skins too. 

dni: basic dni criteria + zionists and freaks (/neg).
i will hide you

boundaries idk:
- please don't randomly fq me. either ask or at least have spoken to me a bit. 
- if i don't know u, pls don't randomly initate rp with me (that shit's annoying (unless its like saying silly stuff in character yk))
- pls don't push your ships on me when im a character u ship another with (unless its jokey banter)
